# ðŸŽ² Simple Dice Game

This is a basic web-based dice game using JavaScript. When you click the "Roll" button, it randomly generates a number from 1 to 6.

## Rules
- If you roll a 6, you win.
- Otherwise, try again.

## Why this project?
This is a starting point for building simple luck-based games like those used on Stake.com. Future plans include adding:
- Payout logic
- Provably fair mechanism
- Multiplayer support
